Fake Podcast RSS Feed

This project is just an experiment to see what hosting a podcast RSS feed on github.io would look like. Consider it a proof-of-concept.

RSS snippets have been sourced from the following pages, purely for academic purposes:
* https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_rss.asp
* https://www.ausha.co/blog/creating-an-rss-feed-for-your-podcast/ (nevermind, just pics of code)
